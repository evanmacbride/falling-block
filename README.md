# Falling Block Game
A jQuery based version of a classic video game. It's very much a work in progress, but the game will soon have all the mechanics one would expect from a falling block game. The general aesthetic of the game is based on the anthropomorphic video game system [BMO](https://adventuretime.fandom.com/wiki/BMO) from the television series Adventure Time, and the game's color palette was captured from the series' second episode [Trouble in Lumpy Space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZTIeqlmzlw).
